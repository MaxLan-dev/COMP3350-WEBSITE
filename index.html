        <p>
          FitTrack empowers individuals to achieve their unique fitness and
          nutrition goals through a simple, adaptable exercise and weight
          management tool, helping to create healthier lifestyles for all. In
          today’s busy world where time is a premium, FitTrack aims to quickly
          and effectively serve health-conscious users and consolidate their
          needs into one system.
        </p>
        <p>
          FitTrack is designed for health-driven individuals who prioritize
          managing their fitness and nutrition effectively but need a
          convenient, all-in-one solution to fit into their busy lifestyles. The
          target audience includes people with a range of fitness goals—whether
          they are beginners looking to lose weight, fitness enthusiasts aiming
          to maintain their progress, or athletes striving to optimize their
          performance. These users value simplicity, personalization, and
          flexibility in a system that adapts to their goals and preferences.
          FitTrack appeals to those who seek a reliable, seamless tool to
          streamline their health management without the need to juggle multiple
          applications or complicated interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can set personalized fitness goals—whether it’s gaining,
          maintaining, or losing weight—and receive actionable guidelines to
          help achieve them. With the ability to modify their goals at any time
          and set custom time frames, FitTrack seamlessly adjusts to the evolving
          needs and lifestyles of its users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system generates personalized exercise plans based on the user’s
          fitness goals, complemented by meal suggestions tailored to their
          recommended daily calorie intake. These suggestions include preset
          meals with detailed macronutrient information, offering users a quick
          and easy way to plan their nutrition. Additionally, users can add their
          own recipes to the system, enabling them to track and manage their
          unique dietary preferences. This combination of customization and
          guidance ensures that FitTrack supports a wide range of lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of FitTrack lies in its ability to simplify and centralize
          fitness and nutrition management into one comprehensive tool. By
          combining exercise tracking, personalized meal plans, and flexible
          goal-setting in a single platform, FitTrack eliminates the need for
          multiple apps, saving users time and effort. Additionally, it will be
          easy to use, making it accessible to individuals at all fitness levels,
          encouraging consistent use and long-term success.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success of FitTrack will be measured by several key indicators.
          First, we aim to gather positive feedback from 90% of active users
          within six months of using the system, where an active user is someone
          who signs into the system on four unique days in any week. Additionally,
          through simple surveys, we expect at least 50% of active users to report
          achieving measurable progress towards their health and fitness goals,
          where they will be asked questions regarding their physical performance,
          weight changes, or overall well-being, demonstrating the system’s
          effectiveness and user satisfaction.

            <h3 class="list-heading">What Went Right</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The refactoring and debugging after Iteration 2 allowed us to deliver a functional product for Iteration
                3.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our merge conflict strategy, refined after the first iteration, worked well and prevented further
                conflicts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reviewing commits after each developer completed a task, and manually checking those changes, helped
                prevent new bugs and SOLID violations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Assigning clear separation of concerns across the User, Food, and Exercise streams enabled smooth
                development and efficient workflows.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Block: What Went Wrong -->
          <div class="postmortem-block wrong">
            <h3 class="list-heading">What Went Wrong</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the early iterations, we didn't fully understand the project requirements or how to use the provided
                tools.
              </li>
              <li>
                During Iterations 1 and 2, we trusted that each developer's code was fine without reviews. This led to
                bugs that emerged later.
              </li>
              <li>
                There was a lack of clear documentation or guidance on using some tools. Much of what we learned came
                from trial and error.
              </li>
              <li>
                We didn’t request intermediate updates on progress, which allowed several features to go undeveloped
                until late in the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Having multiple developers work on the same stream (User/Food/Exercise) created interdependencies that
                slowed development.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <div class="list-container">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In Iteration 2, we decided to assign each developer a dedicated stream (User/Food/Exercise) instead of
                  dividing by layers. This worked well, as everyone could focus on and understand their responsibilities
                  more clearly, leading to smoother development.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We originally planned to hold more team meetings and pair programming sessions. However, we didn’t end
                  up doing any meetings—and surprisingly, this worked out. Everyone was able to stay focused and
                  complete their tasks independently without disruptions.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The final product is significantly different from our original vision. Initially, we aimed to build a
                  full-featured calorie planner with meal and exercise planning. Due to the complexity involved, we
                  delivered a simpler calorie counter. However, this provides a solid base that can be extended into a
                  full planner in the future.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Not everyone will complete their tasks on time, so it’s important to follow up and verify what’s done
                  and how it’s done.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will no longer assume other people's code is good by default—we’ll always review it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Going forward, we will assign developers to specific functional streams rather than abstract layers.
                  This approach clearly works better for us.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Always review code, even if it’s written by someone you trust. A second pair of eyes helps catch bugs
                  and ensures quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Refactoring and debugging are powerful tools — even projects that seem off track can be recovered with
                  the right focus and teamwork.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Efficient communication and clearly defined roles help reduce confusion and boost productivity.
                  Working in focused, independent streams proved more effective than overlapping responsibilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It’s essential to manage technical debt early; ignoring it can compound issues and cost more time
                  later in the project.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tools and environments should support your workflow — but it's the team's discipline and coordination
                  that ultimately determine success.
